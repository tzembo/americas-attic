# americas-attic

This is a final project for ENAS 410/ARCH 390, a project-based class taught through Yaleâ€™s Center for Engineering, Innovation, and Design. In partnership with the Smithsonian Institution, my classmates and I reimagined the Arts and Industries Building and how it can tell forward-thinking stories of American innovation it its next exciting chapter.
